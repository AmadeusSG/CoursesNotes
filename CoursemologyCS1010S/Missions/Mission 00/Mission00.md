## MIssion 0: Setting up Python

###Description
The objective of this mission is to guide you in the installation and setting up of the programming tool, called IDLE, that you will be using for the rest of the semester. Also, we included a simple exercise to help you familiarize yourself with the basics of Python, and also learn how to submit homework through the Coursemology platform.

This missions consists of only **one** task. Please do your work inside the template file provided instead of copying the code out from the PDF file. This is because copying text from PDF files introduces weird problems with some copied characters.
